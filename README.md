# Deep_Learning_Project,

Hello, I'm ihsan,
In this section, I will share with you my projects that I have done during my deep learning training. Actually, on the day I finished these projects, I was sharing them on LinkedIn and Kaggle, I wanted to together bring these projects that I shared separately on the GitHub platform and share them with you. I made these projects on the way to improving myself. On the way to improving myself, I started with Data Science then continued with Machine Learning and then I improved myself the topic of Deep Learning. On the way to improving myself, I benefited from the seven-step artificial intelligence courses of DATAITEAM. I had finished first four courses. In this my work, I have finished fifth course and have made projects. I will share the Kaggle links of these projects with you in this section. In this learning path, I would be very happy if you would examine my projects and help me with how to improve my projects or what I should do in this development path. I wish you a good day and good work.
